Welcome to the Python Pizza Shop Simulator! This is a dynamic, text-based game where you take on the role of a pizza chef in a bustling and quirky restaurant. Your goal is to take orders from a variety of interesting customers, make their pizzas correctly, and serve them before their patience runs out!

This project is built entirely in Python and demonstrates key programming concepts like Object-Oriented Programming, multithreading, and user authentication in a fun, interactive command-line environment.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Demo

The entire game runs in your terminal. Here's a quick look at what you'll see:

**A customer arrives with a unique order and hints:**
```

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is built with clear, reusable classes like `Pizza`, `Customer`, and `VIPCustomer`, demonstrating a solid OOP structure.
-   **Multithreading**: A separate thread generates new customers in the background while you play, making the game dynamic and unpredictable.
-   **Real-Time Challenge**: Customers have a 'Patience' timer that ticks down based on how long you take to make their order. Serve them quickly or they'll leave!
-   **VIP Customers**: Encounter special VIP customers who have higher priority and offer discounts, showcasing the use of **inheritance**.
-   **User Authentication**: A simple login and registration system ensures player scores are tied to a specific user.
-   **Scoring System**: Earn points for each correctly fulfilled order and track your performance.
-   **Interactive Menus**: The game is navigated through a series of intuitive command-line menus.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Concepts Demonstrated

-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Extensive use of classes and objects to model the game's components.
-   **Inheritance**: The `VIPCustomer` class inherits from and extends the `Customer` class.
-   **Encapsulation**: The `AuthManager` and `VIPCustomer` classes use private attributes to protect their internal state.
-   **Multithreading**: The `threading` module runs the customer generation process concurrently with the main game loop.
-   **Data Structures**: Use of lists and dictionaries to manage customers, toppings, prices, and user data.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Class Diagram

The game is architected around the `PizzaGame` class, which manages the main loop and game state. It utilizes an `AuthManager` for user sessions and dynamically generates `Customer` objects, which can also be specialized `VIPCustomer` objects.
