Welcome to the Python Pizza Shop Simulator! This is a dynamic, text-based game where you take on the role of a pizza chef in a bustling and quirky restaurant. Your goal is to take orders from a variety of interesting customers, make their pizzas correctly, and serve them before their patience runs out!

This project is built entirely in Python and demonstrates key programming concepts like Object-Oriented Programming, multithreading, and user authentication in a fun, interactive command-line environment.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Demo

The entire game runs in your terminal. Here's a quick look at what you'll see:

**A customer arrives with a unique order and hints:**
```

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is built with clear, reusable classes like `Pizza`, `Customer`, and `VIPCustomer`, demonstrating a solid OOP structure.
-   **Multithreading**: A separate thread generates new customers in the background while you play, making the game dynamic and unpredictable. No two playthroughs are the same!
-   **Real-Time Challenge**: Customers have a 'Patience' timer that ticks down based on how long you take to make their order. Serve them quickly or they'll leave!
-   **VIP Customers**: Encounter special VIP customers who have higher priority but offer discounted prices. This feature showcases the use of **inheritance** by extending the base `Customer` class.
-   **User Authentication**: A simple but effective login and registration system ensures that player scores and status are tied to a specific user.
-   **Scoring System**: Earn points for each correctly fulfilled order and track your performance.
-   **Interactive Menus**: The game is navigated through a series of intuitive command-line menus.

## üöÄ How to Play

1.  **Run the Script**: Start the game from your terminal.
2.  **Login/Register**: Create a new user or log in with an existing one.
3.  **Start the Game**: From the main lobby, select "Start Game".
4.  **Wait for Customers**: New customers will arrive automatically every 20 seconds.
5.  **Serve a Customer**: From the game menu, select a customer by their number to view their order.
6.  **Read the Hints**: Use the customer's unique hints to figure out which toppings they want.
7.  **Make the Pizza**: Enter the numbers corresponding to the correct toppings to complete the order.
8.  **Earn Points**: Correct orders earn you points and increase your completed order count. Be fast and accurate to get the highest score!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Concepts Demonstrated

This project effectively demonstrates several important programming concepts:
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Extensive use of classes and objects to model the game's components.
-   **Inheritance**: The `VIPCustomer` class inherits from and extends the `Customer` class.
-   **Encapsulation**: The `AuthManager` and `VIPCustomer` classes use private attributes (`_users`, `_discount`) to protect their internal state.
-   **Multithreading**: The `threading` module is used to run the customer generation process concurrently with the main game loop.
-   **Data Structures**: Use of lists and dictionaries to manage customers, pizza toppings, prices, and user data.
